# KeywordRank-Analyzer

## Description
This repository contains my Information Retrieval course project that implements a complete system for analyzing and tracking website rankings for specific keywords on Google search results.

The system consists of three main components:
1. **Backend**: A Node.js/Express server with MongoDB for data management
2. **Crawler Bot**: A Python script using Selenium to perform Google searches and track rankings
3. **Frontend**: A Vue.js dashboard to visualize the ranking data.

## Key Features
- CRUD operations for managing websites and keywords
- Automated Google search bot that tracks keyword rankings
- Dashboard with visualizations showing ranking trends over time
- Excel import/export functionality for bulk keyword management
- Daily search limits and randomized click behavior to simulate human patterns

## Documentation
The project documentation (in Persian) explains the system architecture, implementation details, and results analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Crawler: Python, Selenium
- Frontend: Vue.js (not included)
- Data Analysis: Pandas

This project was completed in February 2024 as part of my Information Retrieval course requirements.
